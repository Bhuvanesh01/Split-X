# Split-X

It is a software developed in java for splitting up files and merging them. As it is usually easier to send/receive,
upload/download smaller parts than handle the entire file in one go. So through this software, a user who wants to split
big files to small parts and wants to either send/store or upload these small files can do these stuff easily.
